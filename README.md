# Ycode-linux
idk why i did this but i tried to do an Xcode from mac to linux (and windows) in python I used a little bit of chatgpt to help but he just help me to code and nothing else.
# How to use it
you can download the .py and modify it if you want or download the folder linux or windows
# Linux version
the linux version is the first one to have update because who tf code on windows now(just kidding) but I prefer to do the update first on linux
# Windows version
it will not have the update at the same time as linux but I will try "same day delivery"
# Mac version
download Xcode on your appstore

# Lcode-linux
idk why i did this but i tried to do an Xcode from mac to linux (and windows) in python I used a little bit of chatgpt to help but he just help me to code and nothing else.
# How to use it
you can download the .py and modify it if you want or download the folder linux or windows
# Linux version
the linux version is the first one to have update because who tf code on windows now(just kidding) but I prefer to do the update first on linux
# Windows version
it will not have the update at the same time as linux but I will try "same day delivery"
# Mac version
download Xcode on your appstore
# what else
i use pyqt5 and not pyqt6 but i will try
# 0.1 Linux version
its a good IDE for the moment but it will be better later! it can build and run and open a terminal to execute (try you will see)
# if you found an error 
go to the Issues tab and tap the new issue button explain how to do the bug and if you are good at python you can try to explain but this is totaly optional!
